ajax-example
============

This script contains three files (index.html, ajax.php & jquery.js) that- when put on a server that can run PHP- will function as a simple AJAX example using jQuery and PHP. For this example, the form will contain one field, and the validation will simply check to see if that field is empty.

This script was created to be very simple, and very easy to repurpose for various projects.
